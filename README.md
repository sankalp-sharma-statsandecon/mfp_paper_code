# mfp_paper_code
Stata code for MFP data cleaning and econometric specifications

The first half of the code specifically deals with finding counties of the city names. Please note this process is not perfect and manual editing is required because some citys are spelt differently in the orginal .dta file versus the source file. The manual data edits are not shown in the code and are only represented by a comment. Contact original author for details.
